## Mini Docs

Add intro sounds for specific members of your discord channel. In mongodb inside your intros store
    
    {
        "user": "Anne",
        "sound": "cena",
        "ext": "mp3"
    }

When the user Anne enters the channel or unmutes the John Cena sound will play. Note that the sound must exist in the sound folder.

Play a random meme with `!meme` 

Typing `!bot game` will TTS the current chat channel saying its time to play CS. It will also DM every online user and ask them if they're keen to play. It will then display the online users.

The names of sounds are stored in mongodb. If new sounds are added it will display them in the main chat after deployment + someone issuing a bot command.

Typing `!bot help` with DM you all the available commands.

Typing `!bot tts "This will be the tts text when triggered in the channel" !cmd` will store a tts binding for !cmd. This is stored in mongodb.

Typing `!bot exit` will force the bot to leave the current users voice channel.

Typing `!yt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNiXGX2nLU 0 1` will stream the youtube audio to the current users voice channel. (0 and 1 are both optional)0 is the time you want to start from and 1 is the volume.

Typing `!gif dank` will try and a giphy relating to the text 'dank' you can just type `!giphy` itself, this will find a random gif!

Typing `!imdb some movie here` will find the best match for the movie/tv 'some movie here' and display it in chat.

Typing `!ud meme` will attempt to search for the urban dictionary definition for the word 'meme'. using just `!ud` will find a random definition.

Typing `!ud coin` will flip a coin.

Typing `!mama` will generate a random yo momma joke

Typing `!hltv` will get the current live pro csgo games from hltv.org

Typing `!spell denk maemae` will try and verify the spelling of each parameter after !spell

Typing `!clear 3` or `!clear` will clear the last N chat messages, defaulted to 10.

Typing `!dota` will get the current live pro dota matches

Typing `!fml` will grab a random fml quote

Typing `!chuck` will grab a random chuck norris danker quote

Typing `!auth` will send you the invite code required to get some dank up in your server


`commands.set(<regexp>, array[type, reply])` - `regexp` is what your bot will match messages against, regular expressions are used here mainly to make things case-insensitive. `type` can currently be `function`, `sound`, or `text`, but can be extended further if your bot requires additional functionality.

Ban people from using the command by going in to the config.json file and adding them in to a comma separated list. eg. "user1,user2" 

## Roadmap
- If banned people start talking in voice chat they can be airhorned.

- Ability to easily add new sounds (somehow). Maybe looking for mp3ish files in chat then downloading them to the sounds folder?

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. After completing the prerequisites (below, mainly ffmpeg), run `npm install` on this project making sure nothing fails, particularly `node-opus` (https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48159)
3. Create a mongodb somewhere (MLab/local) then create a connection string for it (e.g mongodb://user:password@server:port/database)
4. Open `env.json` and add your bot's `token`, then add your mongodb connection string for the `mongo` property.
5. Authorize your bot using this URL `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPLICATION_ID&scope=bot&permissions=0` where APPLICATION_ID is your `Application ID` and add it to a server you manage.
6. Run `npm run start` from the project

## Development
You can run 'npm run prep' locally and it will lint/test the app.
